# 🧠 DSA Vault

Welcome to the **DSA Vault**, a neatly organized collection of solutions and code snippets covering core **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in C++.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder represents a core topic in DSA:
- 📊 **Array** – Reversals, searching, sums, and more
- 🌳 **Tree / Binary Tree** – Traversals and structure
- 📚 **Linked List / Stack / Queue** – Implementations and operations
- 🔁 **Recursion** – Subsets, permutations, Tower of Hanoi
- ⚙️ **Sorting / Searching** – Merge sort, binary search, linear search
- 🧠 **Bitwise / Hash Map / Set / Heap / Graph / Vector** – Fundamental coding techniques
- 🧵 **String** – Basic string operations

## 🚀 Highlights

- Modular C++ code with `.cpp`, `.exe`, and `.o` files  
- Covers both **basic** and **intermediate** problems  
- Follows consistent naming and structure  
- Good starting point for **interview prep** or **DSA revision**

## 🛠️ How to Use

Clone the repo and compile any `.cpp` file:
```bash
g++ DSA.cpp -o DSA
./DSA
