# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - C++ Implementation

Welcome to my C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains implementations and examples of key concepts in DSA using C++. The goal is to provide practical code snippets and explanations to help you understand and apply these fundamental concepts.

## Current Topics

### 1. Recursion

Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. In this section, you'll find:

- **Basic Recursive Functions:** Examples demonstrating simple recursive functions.
- **Recursion in Algorithms:** Implementations of recursive algorithms.
- **Common Recursive Patterns:** Patterns and strategies to effectively use recursion.

### 2. Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store collections of items. This section includes:

- **Basic Array Operations:** Examples showing how to create, access, and manipulate arrays.
- **Array Algorithms:** Implementations of common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and rotating arrays.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** Insights into dynamic array concepts and their benefits over static arrays.

## Future Topics

I plan to expand this repository with additional topics, including:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Hashing and Hash Tables
- Advanced Algorithms (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mansiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii/DSA.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd DSA
   ```
3. **Compile and Run the Examples:**
   You can compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler like `g++`. For example:
   
   ```bash
   g++ Equivalent Trail Recursive.cpp -o Recursion
   ./Equivalent Trail Recursive
   ```
