# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains implementations of various DSA concepts using C++. Currently, it includes solutions for recursion and array-related problems. I plan to expand this repository with more data structures and algorithms in the future.

## Table of Contents

- [Recursion](https://github.com/Mansiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii/DSA/tree/main/Recursion)
- [Arrays](https://github.com/Mansiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii/DSA/tree/main/Array)

## Recursion

In the `recursion` directory, you'll find implementations of classic recursion problems:

- **Sum of First N Numbers**: Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers.
- **Tail Recursion**: Demonstrates the concept of tail recursion.
- **Non-Tail Recursion**: Shows an example of non-tail recursion.
- **Josephus Problem**: Solves the Josephus problem using recursion.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Computes the Fibonacci series up to N terms.
- **Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Solves the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- **Subset Sum Problem**: Finds subsets of numbers that add up to a specific target sum.
- **N to 1**: Recursively prints numbers from N to 1.
- **Generate Subset**: Generates all subsets of a given set.

## Arrays

In the `arrays` directory, you'll find various operations and algorithms involving arrays:

- **Check if Array is Sorted**: Verifies if an array is sorted in ascending order.
- **Find Largest Element**: Finds the largest element in an array.
- **Operations on Array**: Includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Removes duplicate elements from an array.
- **Reverse an Array**: Reverses the order of elements in an array.
- **Second Largest Element**: Finds the second largest element in an array.
- **Vectors in C++**: Demonstrates the use of vectors in C++.
